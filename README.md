# Loan Eligibility Predictor

This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant information. It includes preprocessing, training a Logistic Regression model, and deploying a Streamlit web app.

```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Place `credit.csv` in the `data/` folder.
4. Run the full pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
5. Launch the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Output

- Model training with accuracy report
- Streamlit app for interactive prediction
